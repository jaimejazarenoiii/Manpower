## Coordinators
Will handle the navigation of a certain flow, navigation by means pushing, presenting, dismissing and popping. 

## Flow

Continuous stream of navigation of view controllers.
E.g
* . This is considered as one flow so we group it into one coordinator.

* When do we separate it to another coordinator? If it has its own flow inside. Like this one:
![SignupCoordinator](https://i.imgur.com/71uvJdf.png)
Earlier, we put the signup page inside onboarding coordinator, because it doesn't have its own flow, it's considered a page inside of onboarding flow, but now since the sign up page has multiple screens due to multiple steps for signing up, we can now separate it to a new coordinator.
